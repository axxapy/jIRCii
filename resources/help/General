<br>
<br>The jIRCii Help system is divided up into two sections.  The section you are currently in is the General Help.  This section is 
meant to offer help on general concepts such as how to send formatted text to a channel or how to use the help system.
<br>
<br>The other section is the commands section.  jIRCii features a plethora of built in commands.  The built in help for jIRCii 
commands all follow certain conventions.
<br>
<br>The example below is the command help for the <b>/j</b> command. The /j command is a shortcut to join a channel.  At the top 
of the command help is a brief description of the /j command and the parameters it takes.  
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000099">/j</b> &lt;[#]channel&gt; [key]<br><br>Joins the specified channel.  If you are already on that channel, 
jIRCii will set the status window query to the specified channel<br><br><b><font 
color="#333333">Parameters:</font></b><br>&lt;[#]channel&gt; - channel to join/query<br>[key] - channel key<br><br><b><font 
color="#333333">Example:</font></b>
<br>/join #jIRCii
<br>
<br>Parameters enclosed in [ ] square brackets are optional.  That is they can be specified but don't have to be.  Parameters 
enclosed in &lt; &gt; angle brackets are required parameters.  In the above example the channel [key] is an optional parameter.  
Also typing # before a #channel is optional as well.  
<br>
<br>The rest of the command help also includes a description of each of the parameters.  Most commands also include an example or 
two of the command syntax.
