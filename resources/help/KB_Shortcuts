<br>
<br>Besides the plethora of built in /commands jIRC also offers a few other built in command features.
<br>
<br><b>Edit the Color Scheme</b></font>
<br>
<br>In jIRCii you can easily edit the colormap (colors 1-99) by holding the shift key and clicking on colored text you want to edit.  Most event echos have there own color assigned to them.  The statusbar can be shift+click'd on as well.  To edit colors inside of the nicklist use shift+control+click.  Background colors can be edited outside of the nicklist using shift+control+click.
<br>
<br><b>Nick Completion</b></font>
<br>
<br>When having a conversation in a channel sometimes you want to direct a message at a specific person.  In jIRC you can simply specifypart of a nickname followed by a : colon and then your message.  jIRC will then complete the entire nickname for you.  For directing a message to Tijiez I'd simply type:
<br>
<br><font color="red" face="Monospaced"><small>Tij: rock on homeZ&lt;ENTER&gt;</small></font>
<br>
<br>The above would be sent to the active channel as:
<br><font color="blue" face="Monospaced"><small>Tijiez: rock on homeZ.</small></font>
<br>
<br><b>Tab Nick Completion</b></font>
<br>
<br>Another popular style of nick completion supported by jIRC is Tab key nick completion.  This is where you type part of a nick and then hit the Tab key.  The last word in the editbox will then be completed to a full nickname.  If the editbox is empty hitting tab will bring up /msg &lt;last person to msg you&gt; in the editbox.
