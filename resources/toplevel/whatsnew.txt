Release 0.9.0-r26 (22 Dec 12)
- Files missing from svn tree (AttentionDialog.java) for Notification support added.

Release 0.9.0-r25 (22 Dec 12)
===
- Typo and debug condition was left in r24; removed and set back to production. Rebuilt and commited.

Release 0.9.0-r24 (22 Dec 12; the world didn't end. jIRCii chats on!)
===
- Fixed bug introduced in 0.9.0-r23 that effectively nuked titled bordered groups in the options dialogs. Oops.
- Mac OS X: Dock icon now bounces on configurable events, including private message, private notice, channel chat, and kill/kick/disconnect actions. These are configurable under Options->Interface Options->Notifications. By default, only private message and Notice cause the dock icon to bounce. By default it will bounce repeatedly until the application is opened or the dock icon is moused over, but an option is present to disable this and bounce only once under the same Notifications options dialog. NOTE: Windows and Linux users will not have the "Notifications" dialog in their Interface Options menu, as they are not currently supported.

Release 0.9.0-r23 (21 Dec 12; it's the end of the world!)
===
- Maximum input history option made configurable and is accessible via "Options->Interface Options->Window UI->Max Lines of Input History".
- Script predicates isop, ison, etc. no longer case-sensitive (thanks to tricid for the patch).
- Script loading and tracking is now handled consistently internally; bugs involving scripts being loaded more than once are now fixed.
- Problems connecting to stored servers in certain circumstances fixed.
- Connecting to an SSL server with password via auto-connect and "Connection->Connect" menu now works; fixed bug with stored parameters being treated inconsistently.
- Negligible clean-ups and minor modification of text, option text and option mneumonics in the user interface.
- Server display fixed when a server doesn't have a network and/or description value.
- menus.irc recent server (saved.servers) connect item issue fixed
- Support for high-resolution "Retina" Apple displays in OS X enabled preventing the "blur" effect. (Thank you to Sarge for reporting the bug!)
- /op, /deop, /voice, /devoice, etc. now act on all nicknames specified, and no longer work backwards from the end of the list of nicknames. Supports operating on the maximum number of modes per line as specified by the IRC server to which the user is connected.
- Other aliases implemented or changed: /DEHOP, /NAMES, /UMODE, /UNTOP
- Channel names are now utilized more often and checked for validity in the built-ins, with validity based on information from IRC server.
- /UNLOAD now supports -s flag (/unload -s script_name) that will be silent in the case of failure (useful for parent scripts that load and unload children)

Release 0.9 (20 Jul 11)
====

- Added new status and miscellaneous window icons
- Added some white-space to the right of the "close window" button in SDI mode
- Options window is wider to accomodate IRC network selector on OS X

- Added links to the bug tracker and jIRCii homepage in the Help menu
- Updated MacOS X and Windows icons to new jIRCii logo
- Updated Java Application Stub so jIRCii works with MacOS X Lion now.

Beta    45 release 22 Sept 09
====
- Fixed a bug preventing /list -gui window from being closed.  I couldn't
  let this one wait until the next release.
- Fixed tab command completion
- Upgraded to Sleep 2.1u4, several bug fixes and a few new features.  
- $mouse variable in on click/dclick events is now a java.awt.event.MouseEvent 
  object.  You can now call Java methods on this object if you need to.
- Ctrl+Tab now cycles jIRCii windows (similar to Ctrl+Right Arrow)
- fixed a bug with nick changes breaking jIRCii on InspIRCd servers
- jIRCii now supports ! and + channels.  Thanks creative IRCDs!  You're
  really innovating now.

Beta    44 release 7 Aug 08
====
- updated scripting engine to Sleep 2.1-u2.5, over 50 logged improvements
  and feature changes.  If it doesn't break your script you are bound
  to like it.  Here are the compatability changes to watch out for:

  -- this release catches more syntax errors, beware this may affect you
  -- &indexOf now returns $null when no matches were found, check for
     this with the is operator i.e. if (indexOf($str, " ") is $null)
  -- &subarray was renamed to &sublist; &subarray still works just
     be aware that the docs will refer to &sublist

- replaced jIRCii Scripting PDF with a clean HTML version.  Thanks to
  Dan Fare for getting this started
- fixed a Sleep bug that was causing &parseSet to freak out in certain
  cases (this was causing the version reply not halting issue found in
  Slurge)
- added &getWindowSize("window name") to get the width of the specified
  window (in pixels)
- added &strwidth('some string') to get the width of the specified string
  (in pixels) using the current font metrics
- trying to connect with no server selected will now bring up a dialog
  asking user to select a server
- fixed Sleep bug with sublist used on read-only arrays (this was 
  breaking /names in some jIRCii scripts)
- reworked timer code to prevent concurrent modification exceptions
  caused by timers making timers or stopping timers during their
  execution
- jircii MDI mode now opens windows maximized if the last active window
  is maximized
- timers now quit when an IRC session is closed
- fixed several roadblocks preventing jIRCii from releasing memory when
  an IRC session is closed.  this change should make jIRCii much more
  stable when running for long periods of time.

[Note to Serge: you may want to recompile your addons]

Beta    43 release 9 May 08
====
- fixed alpha order of some aliases in the Help -> Commands menu
- jIRCii now creates the DCC receive directory if the directory
  does not exist.
- replaced call to skip with in Send.java with skipFully provided by
  nanaki at gmail.com using Find Bugs http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/
- implemented /kill <nick> <reason> command
- updated scripting engine to Sleep 2.1-b25.  
- added a check to the word wrapping code to prevent infinite recursion
  when the window becomes too small.

Beta    42 release 26 Nov 07
====
- Fixed a MacOS X 10.5 (leopard) issue with font metrics.  This is a work
  around to force jIRCii to use the Quartz renderer in lieu of the Sun
  renderer.  I don't know why the Sun one is broken.  Sun: what is up?
- Upgraded to Sleep 2.1-b20.  Lots of changes.  Again view the changelog:
  http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html
- updated CTCP SOURCE reply and internal help documentation to reflect
  current information and URLs
- added a WALLOPS and SEND_WALLOPS sets; updated the default.irc script to
  include these.  also fixed /wallops; per request of drakx
- improved the menubar refresh for server switches by a small factor; 
  ideally I'd like to eliminate this issue but it will take some code
  restructuring to do this.  this is mostly an issue on MacOS X where
  menubar changes take effect immediately (unlike other platforms *ahem*)
- on disconnect the statusbar now immediately shows nick as <Unknown>
- bound Meta+H and Meta+O to open the help and option dialogs
- reconnect now uses the last nickname you held; not your default nick
- fixed a bug with jIRCii's processing of config numerical data--this was
  causing DCC receives to not work and other weird issues for users who
  failed to visit the appropriate options dialog.

Beta    41 last minute update 25 Mar 07 :)
====
- Small last minute update to unbreak a potential issue with script
  debugging.  This really only affects scripters.  My apologies.
- Added a jircii.xpm icon image for Linux users to the extra/ directory
  submitted by mneptok, so thank him if you get a chance.

Beta    41 release 24 Mar 07
====
- Updated to Sleep 2.1-b14 (is it even released yet?).  Lots of changes.
  See the full changelog at: http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html

  Highlights include:
  -- Addition of try/catch blocks and a throw command
  -- Watch variables to assist with debugging 
  -- an include function for including external files into a script
  -- a profiler for seeing where your scripts spend all their time
  -- assignment ops i.e. +=, *=, /= etc.  
  -- performance enhancements and several bug fixes!!

- Fixed a bug where a popup trigger on MacOS X could also trigger a
  mouse clicked event (causing inadvertant creation of query windows
  even when you don't want them).
- Fixed a bug that caused psuedo transparency image to be recalculated 
  with every window resize.  Resizing with psuedo transparency should feel
  a little faster now.
- Disabled apple.awt.showGrowBox property in Info.plist, this stops the 
  drawing of the OS X grow box in the lower right corner (functionallity it
  is still there, this just prevents the box itself from obscuring the client)
- jIRCii Weblaunch/command line options to specify irc URL now allows
  ircs:// URLs for connecting to an SSL server.  Port information is allowed
  as well.

Beta    40 release 12 Oct 06
====

  status window. (Serge) 
  http://jirc.hick.org/cgi-bin/bitch.cgi/view.html?4487090 (Serge)
- Fixed: Nicknames do not show non-idle status after an action
  http://jirc.hick.org/cgi-bin/bitch.cgi/view.html?1912086 (Serge)
- Added a naming conventions for scripts to allow a charset to be specified
  when loading the script.  The convention is:

  List of valid charsets: http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets
- Fix for http://jirc.hick.org/cgi-bin/bitch.cgi/view.html?4225366
  Double click is now the default to open links and channels.
  dclick.links config option controls this behavior (Serge)

  $item is set to window name, $clicks is set to number of clicks (Serge)
- $clicks variable added for all click events (Serge)
- Ctrl+X now cuts text instead of cycleQuery() which is now Ctrl+Z.
  It's a fix for http://jircii.hick.org/cgi-bin/bitch.cgi/view.html?8150450
  (Serge)
- Fixed pasting of multiple lines deleting current input field text (Serge)
- Implemented automatic word wrapping of long messages if packet doesn't
  fit 512 bytes RFC length. For details check this link:
  http://www.resultspk.net/hackirc/irchks-chp-13-sect-3.html (Serge)
- Fixed modes in nicklist and status bar (all possible channel modes
  should be correctly supported now, including &, ~, .) (Serge)
- Fixed &getModeFor returning 2 characters in some cases. According
  to docs it should always return the highest channel mode user has
  as a single character (Serge)
- Added @ &getModeChars function, returns channel mode chars supported
  by the server (@,%,+,&,~,.) (Serge)
- Fixed modes parsing for modes not currently handled by jIRCii internal
  data structures (this caused problems like incorrect modes for users
  in the nicklist) (Serge)
- Whois codes support (671 - Unreal secure connection, 310 - Unreal
  available for help, 703 - ircd-RU translation scheme) (Serge)

  time for all users (not only users that are on the same server) (Serge)
- Upgraded scripting engine to Sleep 2.1-b6 lots and lots of changes (Raffi)
- Added a /debug command for setting the trace, warn flags for a script i.e.:
  /debug xdcc.irc +trace or /debug xdcc.irc -trace  (Raffi)
  scripts can programatically set debug flags, see the sleep docs for more
  info
- fixed a bug with on input event breaking setInputText, text is immediately
  cleared from edit box prior to fireing events.  Typed text is available as
  $1- within on input though

Beta    39 release 07.30.05
====
- The find feature is now case insensitive (oracel)
- Fixed bug in command history, the history was not reset when pasting
  multiple lines of text (oracel)
- Fixed flipped Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click behavior in the nicklist (Serge)
- Modified the built-in /topic command to display the current topic
  instead of unsetting it if no topic message was specified. (oracel)
- Added the built-in command /ut to unset the topic in a given channel.
  (oracel)
- Both /topic and /ut now uses the currently active channel name if no
  channel name is excplicitly given as a parameter to the respective
  commands (oracel)
- Fixed bug with quit message showing twice in the status (turned out to
  be a problem with the printAll function which has been fixed).

  loaded modules to be instantiated only once for all jIRCii sessions
- fixed several bugs in the MDI window management routines

- jIRCii command history behavior has been completely overhauled to feel
  more like mIRC and other clients (oracel)
- fixed pasted text being omitted from command history (oracel)
- a bug has been fixed where jIRCii list dialogs (/list etc.) did not
  have the appropriate row height set (Serge)
- windows can now be closed by shift+clicking the switchbar button (Serge)
- added better URL matching for clicked links (Serge)
- added a check to getModeFor() to prevent a null pointer exception
- fixed a potential deadlock issue from the listbox painting code
- upgraded scripting library to Sleep 2.0-stable
- fixed repainting issues with the channel listbox and statusbar under XP
  (Serge/raffi)
- fixed bug with auto resume option, if a file is complete, auto resume
  will no longer pop up a dialog asking you to rename the saved file.
  (the idea behind the auto options is to be hands off...); a message is
  fired to indicate this case as well.
- moved the Update IAL on Join and Auto Reconnect options to a new dialog
  panel called Client Options
- added an option to strip out all formatting codes from IRC messages
- fixed /load ~/file not resolving ~

Beta    37 release 07.13.05
====
- fixed resource loading to ensure files in .jIRC have priority over 
  internal resources
- updated to Sleep 2.0-b11 (from b9)
  be aware! the behavior of single quoted strings has changed slightly.
  '\\' is now \; this breaks fserve.irc and I recommend if you are using 
  it that you upgrade immediately
- rename window now does nothing if the new window name already exists...  
  thanks to serge for the bug report (now about that text selection...)
- unbroke Alt+1 .. Alt+n for channel switching 
- made a jIRCii launch service change, altnick is now based on the 
  specified primary nick iff no altnick exists and a primary nick is 
  speciifed.  If no primary nick is specified jircii will use the 
  lamer_nnnn nickname.  
- made auto reconnect on disconnect an option (under IRC Options dialog)
- on disconnect initial IRC_RECONNECT message goes to all windows, 
  subsequent ones only go to the status window
- fixed a bug where dcc receive was not closing file handle when an error 
  occured.
- added ~ expansion for tab based file completion, /dcc send, /send, 
  /theme, and /load ~ expands to your home directory if it is the first 
  character...  :)
- fixed occasional switchbar button disappearing bug as reported by simple
- added the ability to position the switchbar on the left or right side 
  of the jIRCii window
- fixed a startup visual artifact on OS X with the metal L&F

Beta   36 release 06.18.05
====

- added getNextPort() for retrieving the next dcc port to be used
- fixed dcc chat, actions, etc. to preserve leading spaces.
- resynchronized the sorted users stuff
- added an overly redunant check to prevent scripts from being loaded twice.
- implemented a check to ensure timers don't execute closures from unloaded
  scripts.

- upgraded to Sleep 2.0-b9 (many many cool additions/changes)
- fixed small selection bug

Beta   35 Release 06.11.05
====
- upgraded scripting library to Sleep 2.0-release candidate bringing 
  several bug fixes and a few new features
  -- foreach loops now automatically convert hash parameters into their keyset.
  -- added a new foreach syntax:
     foreach $index => $value (source) { }
  -- the remove() function now takes multiple parameters for multiple items to 
      remove.
  -- fixed a bug parsing tuple assignments in certain cases.
  -- added a &subarray(@array, n, [m]) function for extracting an array slice
  -- reworked the pack/unpack format strings to make them more useful
  -- fixed a bug with the pack/unpack format string parser not assigning the 
     specified integer to the last format character.
- fixed Window menubar menu showing the Status window twice.
- fixed bug with empty ison replies echo'ing to the status window (I think)
- setup all timer execution to happen in the swing event thread.  this 
  has its pros and its cons.  main pro is it will mean a much more stable 
  jIRCii (in theory) cons, heavy timer activity could cause jIRCii to take 
  a performance hit.
- fixed a bug with topic/mode changes by ChanServ not showing any nick as 
  having changed the topic/mode.
- made text selection y pt->line number translation more accurate
- fixed bug where antialias hint was not being used to calculate font width 
- hacked in a find dialog for searching jIRCii windows, use Ctrl+F, 
  Alt+F, Meta+F to invoke it.

Beta   34 Release 05.08.05
====
- users who are no longer visible to the irc session (i.e. quits, people 
  not on a common channel with you) are removed from the internal data 
  list on part and quit events.
- added a switchbar option to always sort the switchbar buttons
- &getWindows() now includes the %STATUS% window in the list
- adjusted how jIRCii calculates text width/height metrics for the custom 
  text display, should make serge happy.
- added %GLOBAL, a hash whose contents is shared across scripts and across
  servers.   Should make the blue-elf happy.
- fixed extra character being appended to mode $parms string
- added error detection for attempting to use foreach loop on a non
  array value.
- updated &use() to only instantiate dynamically loaded class once
  other scripts loading this same class will share the instance

** I updated beta 34 at 10am CET to adjust the height font metrics back
   to the old method.  The new width calculations are staying in **

Beta   33 Release 05.01.05
====
- added support for ISUPPORT numeric 005.  This information is available 
  as a hash scalar via &getSupportHints();
- PREFIX variable from ISUPPORT is used to map user modes on channels
- added a hasmode predicate i.e. if ($nick hasmode $channel) { }
- added a &getModeFor("nick", "#channel") to return the mode display 
  character that nick has on #channel
- fixed bug with perform on connect not firing on servers with no MOTD - Elly
- added a $channels variable which is available inside of the QUIT event/set
- /me now works in a DCC Chat
- added an option to View -> Options -> IRC OPtions to disable auto 
  update of internal address list on channel join
- optimized the drawing of text selection a little bit.  you might not 
  notice, but I did spend 3 hours on it.
- updated &addTimer to interpret parameter as a sleep closure
- added "reconnect.time" property (set to 5s by default).  this variable 
  controls how long jIRCii sleeps between attempted reconnects.
- personal idle timer is now reset even if the on input event is halted
- fixed clickable URL's not working with "www.somesite.com"
- array index operator can now be applied to HOES expressions i.e.
  $var = ["this is a string" split: " "][1]

Beta   32 Release 04.24.05
=====
- upgraded Sleep library to Sleep 2.0-b6, new scripting features galore.

Stable 31 Release 03.20.05 (Maintenance Release)
=====
- fixed 100% cpu usage when moving the jIRCii window on Windows
- functions tileWindows(), cascadeWindows(), activateSession(), 
  setSessionColor(), and setSessionText() now take place on the UI thread.  
  This is to prevent a deadlock situation.
- window parameter in getWindowState() and setWindowState() is now optional to
  allow accessing the state of the main jIRCii window

Stable 30 Release 03.13.05
======
- added parseSet("SET_NAME", %hash), the old option of 
  parseSet("SET_NAME", "target", "parameters") works as well.  This can be used
  in conjunction with %localData to echo a built-in set from an event that 
  halts client output.
- ISON not enough parameters suppressed by broken ircds that can't handle empty
  ISON lists (used for checking lag).
- clickable channel names feature has been adjusted to not fire for channel
  texts ending with a period.  I've been burned by this many times so I 
  decided to fix it.
- jIRCii window now updates background images after being moved.
- added numeric 308 to jIRCii's internal list of whois numerics (not supported
  in the default script though).
- PART messages are only supressed if auto /window on join and part on window 
  close are both enabled.

Beta   29 Release 02.27.05
======
- fixed a bug with using fireEvent() from within an event.
- server connect notices now always go to the status window
- text no longer auto scrolls if you are scrolled up.
- CHANNEL_NAMES set now goes to channel window
- fixed a race condition with echoed text and listbox updating.

Beta   28 Release 02.12.05
======
- Fixed race issues in Sleep parser
- Fixed script stack conflicts caused by the global script cache 
  mechanism
- Removed timer synchronization (this is likely a good thing)
- jIRCii now strips out the unreal mode "!" indicating someone
  is a channel admin, assumes an @ in its place... *crosses fingers*
- added a property "notabs.border" for determining the size of the
  window border when server tabs are turned off... default is 1x
  this is for scripters who really want to tweak things...
- bound Alt+H to open the help dialog
- hard coded the default behavior of double clicking a nickname in
  a channel listbox, this behavior can be overriden with a script.
- removed the garbaged collection call tied to /clear, /clearall
- fixed /run, /exec threading, I was making a method call that
  resulted in the /run, /exec being executed in the current thread.
  this has been fixed.  try /run, /exec again, you'll like 'em.
- on disconnect the first message will be echo'd to every window,
  every disconnect from a reconnect attempt will thereafter be
  echo'd to the status window.
- lag checking is now tied in as part of the notify list requests
  rather than sending a CTCP LAG to yourself every 60 seconds
- temporarily removed IRC Tutorial from Help dialog
- added property "ui.buffersize" which defines the max tolerance
  of the scrollback buffer.  when this value is hit, the scroll
  back buffer is trimmed down to half of the max buffer size.
- added &getButtonColor("window") for retrieving the color of the
  text on a switchbar button in aarrggbb format.
- added &setButtonColor("window", color_in_aarrggbb_format) 
  for setting the color of the text on a switchbar button
- text echo'd using &echoRaw is now logged (if logging is 
  enabled)
- added "switchbar.hilight" option to enable/disable built-in 
  hilighting a switchbar button on activity.
- added on session { } event to signify the current irc session
  becoming activated.
- rewrote sleep predicate parser to allow for right hand side
  expressions to evaluate correctly i.e.:
  if ($x < (3 + 4) / 6) { }
- jircii now handles empty /names replies better...
- added a $mouse variable to on click/dclick/sclick events, this 
  variable contains random info about the mouse event that you
  are more than welcome to parse and do stuff with.

Beta   27 Release 01.29.05
======
- fixed a NPE caused by sleep subroutines with no return value being used 
  in an expression.
- added $handle = &listen(port, [timeout], [$info]) function for creating 
  a simple server socket.  
- On MacOS X the Info.plist file now reflects the correct jIRCii version
- Fixed long standing "ghosted" channel listbox bug.
- Fixed bug with perform on connect / jIRCii Launch service not working 
  on servers that have no MOTD
- The jIRCii script loader now cache's parsed scripts 
- Did more work trying to make jIRCii better about memory.
- added an option to enable/disable text anti aliasing (thanks [Serge])
  check out: View->Options->Font Options
- bound the Home key to move the cursor to the beginning of the input box
- bound the End key to move the cursor to the end of the input box
- fixed timestamp getting the wrong am/pm value for noon.
- clickable URL's are now case-insensitive
- unbroke &mask() function, thanks to blue-elf for pointing this one out
- URL's inside of parentheses (http://www.google.com) are now clickable

Beta   26 Release 01.23.05
======
- Did some work making jIRCii let go of memory.  This will be an ongoing 
  process.
- Added another syntax for events: 

  on event "*source* *target* *parms*" { }

  Essentially the string parameter represents 3 wildcard tokens that 
  describe what event you want to match.  See the jIRCii Scripting 
  Reference for more details.  Descriptive events and normal events will
  still continue to work the same.
- Made the /clear, /cls, and /clearall commands call the garbage collector
  to immediately reclaim memory.

- added a "Scripting Tutorial" to the help window documentation

Stable 12.18.04 - Christmas Maintenance Release :)

  OPEN_URL set
- fixed a null pointer exception with the mouse scroll wheel on a 
  completely cleared window.
- the string %STATUS% is now used to refer to the status window in certain

  to be restarted when a preference changes
- added font size 9 to the font options dialog

  scalars.
- added &hash('key=value', 'user=password', ...) to generate a %hash
- added getScriptResource("script.irc", "resource.file") which returns a 
  properly formatted pathname for the current OS that points to 
  resource.file in the same directory as script.irc

Stable 18 Release 10.31.04
======
- made jIRCii irc parser always match *!*@* as a nick!user@host pattern, 
  no matter what the contents of nick, user, or host are.  (fixes some 
  bugs for example an some irc network puts colors in the hostmask of 
  ircops which freaked out jIRCii)
- oops, somehow internal function fireEvent() was removed from being 
  loaded into the script environment - fixed!
- made the DCC list a synchronized data structure, hopefully preventing 
  lockups when many scripts are trying to access dcc data.

  that needed to be fixed and fixed it.  
- added a check to keep jIRCii windows from stealing the keyboard focus

- added a hook to the tab key binding, if $_IS_FILE_COMPLETE is set to 1 
  then hitting tab will trigger filename completion over all else...

Beta 17 Release 10.24.04
=======
- jIRCii now loads sleep scripts with no charset conversion.
   [ Scripters - this change is a big deal for you.  You can now use 
     upper-ASCII characters in your script and the way they render will be 
     dependent on which font you use, not how Java chooses to mangle the 
     character encoding of your file ]
- selected charset option now works for text sent as well as text 
  received.
- Added what every irc client needs: A SOUND API!@#$$%^  
  The Sound API can be summed up with the following code:

  $sound = loadSound("filename");
  soundPlay($sound);
  soundLoop($sound);
  soundStop($sound);

  Sound files can be a MIDI file, a .WAV file, or a .AU.
- Made Perform On Connect feature case insensitive when matching your
  network preferences to the network you are currently on.
- Fixed cosmetic blemish in the UI Options dialog causing charset options 
  to not paint correctly.
- added function &buildCP437String("string") to do a CP437 charset 
  conversion.  will only work on characters that haven't been converted
  yet (i.e. any text in a script file).  CP437 is the charset that defines
  all those ansi characters everyone is so fond of.

Beta 16 Release 10.16.04
=======
- fixed jIRCii launch service Guest_nn nickname not being random
- tab character is now rendered as 3 spaces.
- added printEOF($handle) function to signal end of file to an i/o output 
  stream.
- fixed bug with jIRCii Launch Service not connecting to servers that 
  aren't specified in the servers.ini file
- made default username information more friendly for lame servers 
  (jIRCii Quick Launch)
- logging mechanism now works for window names with weird characters 
  i.e. |'s and such
- fixed a null pointer exception with /st #channel when your not on #channel
- added a "charset encoding" option to Options->GUI Setup, this allows 
  you to set which charset should be used to interpret data coming from 
  the irc and dcc chat connections.
- Fixed key bindings on non-english locale machines, the fix was to 
  hardcode descriptions for bindable keys in jIRCii's source code.  
- small cosmetic change to options dialog (fix problem with DCC Options 
  on Java 1.5.0)

Beta 15 Release 10.03.04
====
- Updated to Sleep 09.26.04 library
  -- adds use of tuples for assignment i.e. ($x, $y, $z) = @array;
  -- removed whitespace requirement for the string concat operator .
  -- added a strrep("string", "old", "new" for straight up string replacement.
- Updated menus.irc to not use . as part of any variable names.  Sleep 
  doesn't allow this anymore.

  being resolved as the native look and feel.
- Added support for SOCKS v4/5 proxy servers
- Updated to a new servers.ini from Tjerk Vonck (cLAN: mIRC)
- jIRCii now executes key binding code in the "event" thread, hopefully 
  this will prevent code bound to keys from causing any deadlock problems.
- added a check to prevent "perform on connect" commands from being 
  executed again after manually typing /motd
- added support for command line argument in irc://server/channel?key 
  format to cause jIRCii to connect to server and join #channel with 
  specified key.  This is a necessary step to make it possible for web 
  browsers to use jIRCii to handle irc:// links
- updated alias help to include /away, /back, and /nick
- updated /query to actually list all channels your on when typed by 
  itself (the help docs listed this behavior for a long time, it just 
  never had it).
- made jIRCii better about letting go of some memory when closing a 
  window 
- window numbers in "Window" menu now match numbers used for switching 
  windows with Alt+n keyboard shortcut.
- Added SET_NOTIFY and SET_IGNORE for echoing something when the ignore 
  or notify lists are modified via the /notify or /ignore commands...
- text input events are now fired even if user is accidentally holding 
  down shift/ctrl keys while pressing enter.  anything to take care of 
  Zenon.
- Added Ctrl+Left/Right to quickly navigate previous/next server 
  sessions, along with Alt+Left/Right to quickly navigate previous/next 
  channel/query/dcc windows...
- Added function getCurrentWindow() that returns the safest window to 
  echo text to, either the current active window or the status window.  
- Altered getActiveWindow() to return the real current window wether its 
  a special (i.e. dcc list, /list -gui) or not.  This fixes a bug with 
  Ctrl+D on a special window closing the current server connection.
- added &renameWindow("old", "new") for renaming a window, only works on 
  query windows right now.
- added a feature, when a user you have an open /window with changes 
  their nick, jIRCii will rename the window for you.
- added &echoColumns("window", "col1\tcol2\tcol3...", .9) for echoing 
  formatted text that stays in columns similar to how the /names list is 
  wordwrapped
- added /creply command for sending a CTCP reply
- added /eval <expr> command for quickly evaluating and echoing the 
  result of a sleep expression

Stable 14 Release 08.07.04
======
- fixed a nasty bug in the logging causing log files to be open in overwrite
  mode rather than append.
- logging information is now saved to a subfolder based on actual irc network
  rather than the irc server hostname.
- quick cosmetic change to the dcc options dialog
- /newserver now takes the same parameters as /server
- added an option under the windows dialog to adjust the width of the channel
  names listbox.
- enhanced clickable channels a little to allow clicking on @#channel 
  +#channel etc.
- gotta love the decisive nature of my coding... on repl_nnn events have 
  returned but on nnn will continue to work as well.  I won't change this, 
  promise :)
- fixed a bug with failed nickname change (due to changing to fast) 
  messing up jIRCii's internal data structures and throwing an exception.
  nickname change set will not be fired in this case...
- fixed bug in default.irc set SEND_DCC { }, off by one with the 
  parameters

Beta 13 Release 07.31.04  (Stable release candidate)
====
- fixed a problem with the sleep return stack...  it manifested itself in 
  the form of a loose nickname being echo'd to the status window here and 
  there.
- made -lnf argument take precedence over setting to use native look and 
  feel.
- if a channel has no bans set /banstat will echo a message relaying that 
  info.  Added a CHANNEL_BANLIST_END set to go with this.
- made the directory selector widget recognize wether or not its disabled.
- clicking on a channel name will cause jIRCii to join that channel.
- made 'o' the default focus accelerator for the Commands menu, so it no 
  longer conflicts with the Connection menu focus accelerator of 'C'.
- /dcc stats dialog and channel /list -gui dialog sizes and positions are 
  now remember seperately of other sorted windows.
- found a problem with IRC events, apparently on repl_nnn doesn't work, 
  however on nnn where nnn is a numeric does work.  So rather than fix the 
  code I updated the documentation.  set repl_nnn { } is still in use 
  though.
- added a 4th parameter to addTimer(&func, n seconds, r repeats, paramter 
  for &func) basically parameter for &func will get passed to &func 
  whenever the timer is executed.  Useful for creating dynamic timers.  
  Thanks elf.
- fixed bug with dcc sessions dialog close dcc menu option closing the 
  wrong session.  Thanks GulaBapa for pointing this one out.  See I do 
  occasionally listen to my users.
- made tab based file completion case insensitive to shut naz up.

Beta 12 Release 07.25.04
====
- added an expr('3 + 4') function to sleep for evaluating an expression
- added \r (return), \n (newline), and \t (tab separator) escape 
  constants to sleep
- added scripting function setClipboardText("text")
- REPL_321 is no longer mistaken as a /whois reply numeric.
- added normal array @_ to subroutines, which contains all of the 
  arguments passed to the subroutine.
- fixed divide by zero bug with trying to cascade or tile windows when 
  there where no active windows
- enabled SO_KEEPALIVE on dcc chat sockets, this way a dcc chat socket 
  won't sit there forever if the socket actually died awhile back.
- setup a timeout of 60 seconds for dcc send and receive sockets.
- added /banstat [#channel] command for obtaining a list of bans, 
  consequently I added a CHANNEL_BANLIST set to go with this...
- added /unban nick|banmask command to unset all bans related to nick or 
  to unset the specified banmask.
- fixed problem with activateWindow() not working on windows opened as 
  minimized to start with.
- added a check to keep jIRCii from announcing it has resolved your local 
  host info multiple times.
- \t is now the column separator for sorted windows
- added matched() function  to sleep, works like matches("string", 
  'pattern') except it uses the values of the last ismatch comparison.
- added to sleep getFileProper("/path/to", "file") which returns 
  /path/to/file in the appropriate form for the current operating system.
- added tab based file completion to /dcc send, /send, /load, and /theme
- added a function fileCompleteAll("partial file") to access file 
  completion routines. I originally scripted this but decided to make it 
  available for anyone
- reworked directory selection widget in the options dialog, this is to 
  prevent drawing problems due to weird Java layout behavior.  Some 
  functionality was lost but I don't think I really had a choice.

Beta 11 Release 07.17.04
====
- made a for real no kidding hack to keep the timer thread from dieing. 
  fix it? haha yeah right...
- fixed potential divide by zero error when calculating dcc transfer 
  rates.
- removed a typo in the IRC_RECONNECT set (had to log some sort of 
  change).
- rearranged the dcc statistics a little bit and added a field for the 
  total size of the data sent or received.
- added a getScriptPath("filename.irc") function for obtaining where a 
  loaded script exists.
- added an option to fill spaces in a filename when doing a dcc send.
- made the SEND_DCC set friendly to filenames with spaces ($1 = port, 
  $2 = size, $3- = file)
- unbroke sleep function &clear(@array).
- added a &copy(@array) function to sleep which returns a copy of the 
  given array and copies of all of its values.
- fixed bugs with the tab completion... 
- redefined some key bindings:
  Ctrl+C is no longer bound by default, this is to prevent interfering 
  with the function of copying text on Windows.

  The Escape key has been bound to clear the editbox.
- made 'server method' technique for resolving dcc local info the new 
  default
- Added a 'theme' manager.  An easy way to import/export colormap and 
  background color settings for jIRCii.  Along with this comes a /theme 
  "filename" command to load a theme.  Implementation wise it is just a 
  jIRCii generated sleep script.  Loading a theme is basically the same as 
  loading the script and executing it one time only.  Special thanks to 
  Dekkard for the suggestion.
- added a generateThemeScript("filename") function to generate a theme 
  file from the current settings.
- tile and cascade functions for jIRCii now unset maximized property
- added "x" operator to sleep, which is string repetition i.e.
  $str = "abc" x 4; # $str is now "abcabcabcabc"
- updated some of the cosmetics of the help menu.
- gave dcc open messages and dcc close messages their own colors, so they 
  are no longer the same as joins and quits.  (just for you tijiez)
- made sorted windows tie into most normal window events and window 
  manipulation functions, I expect bugs, lets hope not though.  
- added a -isspecial "window name" predicate for determining if a window 
  is a special window (i.e. list dialog, dcc stats, sorted window etc) or 
  not.
- scripted sorted windows are no longer activated by default when opened.  
  To activate them you must explicity call activateWindow("Window title")
- added "on sclick" event for when a row is a double clicked in a 
  scripted sorted window. right now $0 = row number, $1- = window name
- fixed a bug with $window in "on close" always being set to "Status", 
  had to do with the order of close events.
- added a /dns <hostname> command, to go along with it I've also added a 
  RESOLVED_HOST set

Beta (10) Rerelease 07.11.04
====
- fixed a problem causing QUIT messages to now show up.  I don't know 
  where this came from but it is the reason for the rerelease.
- undid b10 change of making IRC_RECONNECT message display once.

Beta (10) Release 07.10.04
====
- window position information is now saved when you close an internal 
  window (used to only be saved when a window was activated... but 
  nooooooo that wasn't good enough).
- added a check to code to prevent /window by itself from opening a 
  unclosable blank window.
- made the size of default windows larger...
- fixed join sync not showing up for channels with different case than 
  what the user joined with.
- fixed a divide by zero problem with getTransferRate()
- added a check to prevent the dcc sessions window from being opened 
  multiple times per session.
- added some synchronization to the stop timers code...
- getWindows() now returns windows in the order they were opened (i.e. 
  the switchbar order) this fixes the Alt+n window ordering problem and 
  makes the Window menu more accurate as well
- altering the position of the listbox is now done in the swing event 
  thread, should fix weird problems where a copy of the listbox becomes 
  ghosted in some position
- Courier New, size 13 is now the default font for Windows and MacOS X, 
  all other platforms will by default use the "monospaced" font.  
- fixed perform dialog bug, sometimes settings for a network would carry 
  over to the "all networks" setting.
- made the /reload filename.irc command apply to all irc sessions
- verbose script loading now displays script loaded message before 
  executing script (but after loading)
- added nickCompleteAll("pnick", "#channel") that returns an array of all 
  nicknames on #channel matching pnick.  the array is sorted from most 
  relevant to least relevant...
- enhanced tab nick completion to cycle through nicknames...
- added tab completion for / commands i.e. /un<TAB> will put /unload in 
  the editbox...  this is experimental, if you don't like it let me know 
  and I'll take it out
- added function getAliasList() that returns an array of all built in 
  aliases and scripted aliases built in aliases are lowercase, and 
  scripted aliases are uppercase.
- attempting to reconnect to server message is now echo'd only once after 
  disconnection this should prevent screen from flooding with attempting 
  to reconnect messages

Beta (9) Release 06.30.04
====
- added a quick way to edit the channel topic:
  type: /topic and then hit <TAB>, the current topic will come up in the 
   editbox found the idea in the irc client irssi.  way to clever.
- "/mode #channel" will now echo the current mode for the given channel, 
  the set CHANNEL_MODE_IS has been added as well
- expanded /mode command a little bit, works as normal otherwise:
  /mode - echos the mode for the active channel
- added /sm command -> a shortcut for the /mode command
- reply 331 (no topic set) now fires set CHANNEL_TOPIC_IS
- added a SEND_DCC set, similiar to SEND_CTCP set
- verbose script loading is now enabled by default
- a error set is now fired (i.e. CHAT_CLOSED, or SEND_FAILED) if jIRCii cannot
  bind a port to listen for the dcc request...
- /notify nickname now adds user to notify list (jIRCii has always had
  /notify <add|remove> <nickname>... however people assumed /notify nick to 
  work).
- the ident daemon now dies disables itself more gracefully when you turn it 
  off in the options after it didn't startup in the first place (bug fix).
- fixed a bug in internal method for resolving the weekday, sunday was comeing
  up as an unknown day.
- hitting enter on an empty textfield now fires an "on input" event with $1- 
  set to ""
- fixed a bug where input halting wasn't being reset after each firing of an 
  input event.
- fixed a case issue with determining wether or not a target is the active 
  query, channels that were active were having text displayed like they were
  inactive due to case differences.
- fixed problem with fixed width switchbar buttons on Windows not 
  dissappearing upon closing a window..
- added a getTimeRemaning($dcc_conn) function for getting the estimated time 
  left for a dcc send/receive connection...  I didn't want to script it so I 
  assume you wouldn't want to either...
- added a formatTime2(n) function for formatting n seconds into a hh:mm:ss form
- added estimated time remaining to "/dcc stats" information
- added "version.addons" internal property, if this property has a value it 
  will be used when jIRCii reports its version information instead of a 
  tagline... a convienent way for scripts to announce that they are loaded
- tweaked the look of the /dcc send "dialog"
- added a check to prevent jIRCii from resuming a file that is already 
  completely downloaded.
- fixed a data structure bug, when a user parted a channel the channel wasn't
  removed from the user's internal list of current channels...  naughty naughty.
- /dcc send dialog and scripted file dialogs now remember the last directory 
  to be worked on.
- added a check to dcc receive, full file paths are now stripped off of 
  incoming dcc requests
- sorted list window's now have properly sized switchbar buttons under the 
  fixed-width setting
- added scripting interface for creating a sorted window and refreshing the 
  data in a sorted window.  See scriptjirc.pdf under the Dialog functions.

Beta (8) Release 06.24.04
====
- fixed a bug with time+date stamp code miscalculating the current weekday
- added a logging feature, now you can log everything... great for turning in
  your friends who brag about the latest DoS attack or creating the latest
  virii.
- worked around a painting problem with the UI Options dialog under OS X
- refactored the /list -gui code so I now have a more generalized window that
  can display data in the same way, made some small cosmetic fixes as well
- DCC_REQUEST set is now actually being utilized.  It was there just not being
  used for some reason.
- added a /dcc stats, it is the same as typing /dcc by itself except it comes
  up in its own window and is updated automatically...

  To go with this I added several sets for customizing this dialogs output
  DCC_LIST_TYPE, DCC_LIST_NICK, and DCC_LIST_INFORMATION, I've also added
  a "dcc" popup menu hook which has a local variable $this for referencing
  the dcc connection.  See the updated scripting docs for more info..
- popup menus will now invoke /list -gui for channel listings.
- switched default font to Java's "Monospaced" which is available on 
  every java platform.
- added a "fixed width buttons" option for the switchbar, under 
  Options->Switchbar the hack to make the fixed width buttons shrink when 
  the switchbar is filled is beyond ugly.
- adjusted the default size of the options window so it will layout 
  properly on other platforms *cough*linux*cough*
- Miscellaneous UI tweaks: font selector, miscellaneous options, script 
  manager, input field (opaqueness)
- Reorganized the Options->Interface Options dialogs.
- text layout tweaks: main display, statusbar, and input field all line 
  up with eachother when drawing text...  there is a 2px buffer between 
  the edge of each component and the first character.
- fixed a bug with editbox font not updating immediately when the font 
  preference is changed
- keys bound with the "bind" keyword are no longer processed by java 
  itself.  once your script gets ahold of the key then thats it.  
  consequently this fixes a bug with my Alt+n and Ctrl+n shortcuts putting 
  numbers in the editboxes when they where being used.
- internal help filenames no longer have spaces in them, fixing a problem 
  with jIRCii's help on Java 1.5 under Linux
- made some changes to the way font metrics are calculated for laying out
  text.  most fonts will now look more centered on the statusbar.
- fixed a null pointer exception when auto joining auto /window'd
  channels...
- expanded irc parser host pattern to accept the = sign

Beta (7) Release 06.11.04
====
- added a kickass little toolbar, there is also an option to disable it 
  under Options->UI Options at first I didn't like it but now its kind of 
  grown on me.
- bug fix: multiple lines of text, when pasted will all be sent to the 
  server...
- added a /list -gui option which pops up a channel /list dialog with 
  sorting and searching abilities
- added a new popup menu hook "list" for the channel /list window. $0 = 
  channel $1 = users $2- = topic
- added a new popup menu hook "switchbar" for the jIRCii window 
  switchbar, $0 = the window name
- fixed a bug with 'on input' event and halt.  once halt got used with an 
  on input event jIRCii would not process any more input (the halt got 
  stuck)... this one pissed me off when I was trying to write an xdcc script.
- clicking edit in the server editor will now select and scroll to the 
  same server in the server editor dialog.
- removed the scriptjirc and sleeplang html files from the jIRCii 
  distribution, I like the pdf better.  The html versions of these files 
  will continue to be available on the jIRCii website.
- fixed a null pointer exception when auto connecting and auto joining 
  channels resulted in stuff happening before all the datastructures were 
  propagated...
- made regular expressions for nickname parsing more liberal, so jIRCii 
  shouldn't have problems parsing nicknames on servers using different 
  charsets (i.e. Korean nicknames)
- added an error message for attempting to reload a script that isn't 
  currently loaded
- fixed scripting documentation, I documented the wrong parameters for 
  sendReply() and sendRequest(); they both require three parameters... not 
  two.
- made multiserver session information querying commands take an index as 
  a parameter, so you can query information about other sessions from a 
  script in one multiserver session.. this affects getSessionColor()
  and getSessionText()
- added a %localData hash variable to help out scripters.  Local 
  variables are basically function parameters, stuff made local with the 
  local() function, event variables etc.  %localData is a read-only 
  hashmap with all of the keys and values for all of the local data

  To see all of the variables passed during a ctcp request event:

  on request
  {
    foreach $var (keys(%localData))
    {
       echo("$var = " . %localData[$var]);
    }
  }

- After having my arm twisted, I've added an on exit event.
- if a variable is empty in the config file (not just non-existent) 
  jIRCii will now use the default value, this should allow anyone to 
  connect even people who fail to set a nickname, realname, email etc...
- rearranged some of the ui options in the interface section of jIRCii's
  options.
- unbroke font previewing under Mac OS X.

Beta (6) Release 06.03.04
====
- added an IRC_ATTEMPT_CONNECT set to go with a message that is displayed 
  when jIRCii tries to connect to a server...
- altered the cosmetics for default.irc's FORMATTED_NAMES to allow for a 
  nick of up to 12 chars in length, anything longer is cut off... this is 
  only in default.irc - your script can do what it wants.
- fixed up default.irc's tab nick completion to not insert a space after 
  the nickname you just nick completed, and to not insert a space if the 
  nickname is the only word in the editbox...
- added keyboard shortcuts Alt+1.. Alt+9 for switching windows using the 
  keyboard...
- added keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+1.. Ctrl+9 for switching server contexts 
  using the keyboard...
- altered the socket timeout stuff to time the irc connection socket out 
  in 5 minutes rather than 30.  If the irc server or client are not 
  responding to eachother (at least for the lag stuff) in 5 minutes then 
  there is definetly a problem.
- fixed a bug where you couldn't type to a dcc chat while not connected 
  to an irc server... thanks elf.
- added a Ctrl+W keyboard shortcut to create a window for the active 
  query...
- added keyboard shortcut Ctrl+D to close the active window
- $me now returns "<Unknown>" when not connected to a server, rather than 
  "" 
- added the ability to auto connect to certain servers on client startup, 
  use the server editor to flag this option.
- added a &serverInfoCommand($server) function for returning the /server 
  command for the given server with all the flags for the user options for 
  that server.
- hopefully fixed bug with autoperform on connect feature misidentifying 
  some servers and joining the wrong stuff for the wrong network.
- added an option for verbose script loading and unloading mainly to 
  shutup blue-elf 
- updated to a new servers.ini released by Tjerk Vonck on 16 Apr 04
- small cosmetic changes to the help menu
- added &callInSession(<session index>, "/command") to execute a 
  command in another session...

Beta (5) Release 03.13.04 
====
- altered some of the cosmetics of the help menu
- decided to make auto /window enabled by default.  this goes against my 
  idea of what the client is all about but it probably should be done. 
- as a corollary to the auto /window enabled by default, all of the echo 
  to active irc options have been enabled by default as well.
- added $window variable to SBAR_LEFT and SBAR_RIGHT sets.
- updated the servers.ini file to the one released by Tjerk Vonck on 25 Feb 04
- removed most of the outdated classes in the test package (unnecessary)
- double clicking a server in the server list now causes jIRCii to connect to
  that server.  thanks eric for complaining about that one.
- added several functions for querying information about the current server
  connection: getServerHost(), getServerPort(), getServerPassword(), 
  isServerConnected(), isServerSecure(), and getServerNetwork()
- removed built in variables $myserverport and $myserver (redundant now)
- updated the Connection -> Connect menu to store all information about a 
  server connection including port, password, and ssl secure or not.  This 
  information is used when reconnecting to the server. 
- made the regular expression for detecting nick!user@host patterns a 
  little more liberal, mainly expanded the user part of the pattern.  This 
  should fix a bug where nicknames don't show up at all i.e. "<> hello!" 
  instead of "<nick> hello!"
- color codes and such are now stripped out of topic when it is put in window
  titlebar.
- added a tooltip to the DCC Dialog's local info option that mentions an IP 
  address can be manually typed in.
- added a perform on connect feature, any commands punched into the perform on
  connect dialog for a specific network will be executed when connecting to that
  network.  useful.  
- added functions for accessing the data contained in the servers.ini file.
- added an option to enable/disable the channel listbox or position it on 
  the left or right of a channel window.  I think hyst asked for this.
- the titlebar of channel windows now shows the channel limit if the 
  channel has one set.
- fixed a problem with word clicking stuff...  kind of miniscule but I'd 
  get the occasional exception because of it.
- added an on unload event...  now scripts can clean themselves up after 
  being unloaded
- when someone says your nickname in a channel there nick will be 
  emphasized a little bit.  (small change in the default script)

Stable (1) Release 02.25.04 
====
- fixed problem with subroutines being called in a file other than the one they   
  were declared in.  this was created by my bugfix for runtime warnings not  
  properly reflecting the file of the executing code.
- altered the way dcc ctcps are echo'd, they now just go to the active window or 
  to the status window pretty much.  (same as normal ctcp's)

Beta (4) Release 02.18.04
====
- fixed small mismatch in default color.map and auto generated color.map
- fixed a race condition in channel user structures against the listbox 
  painting versus irc events...  never really reared its head until I 
  joined a channel with over 1000 people in it.  fixed.
- fixed a problem in -ischannel with empty input ""...  
- altered the way built in 
- altered <tab> binding a little, tab will either popup /msg <last nick 
  to msg you> if the editbox is empty or complete the current word to a 
  nickname.
- altered statusbar format to say jIRCii, how could I miss that :)
- Fixed the way the statusbar is refreshed when a property change occurs.  
  When the font is changed or the statusbar background properties are 
  changed everything should be on cue now.
- altered on input event to use tokenized parameters for passing data.
- added versionString() function to return the version string (basically 
  a date stamp of when the client version was released).
- finally altered and updated /sv and the ctcp VERSION reply.
- fixed interesting bug involving the use of the return statement with 
  foreach loops.  Thanks to era for helping me track this one down at 5am.  
- altered arguments in subroutines.  Arguments passed in subroutines now 
  begin with $1 instead of $0.  The $0 thing was creating way to much 
  confusion so I'm curbing it this way.
- altered sleeputils API to make string scalars check for null 
  initialization values.  An attempt to pass a null value will result in 
  the null scalar being returned.  This fixes some problems in the way 
  jIRC uses sleep as my tokenizer will return null values.
- stripped out most of the built in debug echoes...
- added a check to the script loader for user attempts to load an already 
  loaded script file twice.  this will prevent bad things from happening.
- fixed bug where a runtime warning in a subroutine from another loaded 
  script would not properly reflect which script the error occured in.  
  thanks era for helping me catch this one.  It was actually amazingly 
  easy to fix.  Yay for good design :)
- a statusbar refresh is now forced when a nickname change event occurs.

Beta (3) Release 02.13.04
====
- removed some debugging stuff that would have made it impossible to bind 
  the tab key in scripts.
- renamed getBaseDirectory() to baseDirectory()
- /load will now complain if it can't find a script file you're attempting 
  to load.
- gave custom colors to the opening url message and to ident request 
  messages in default.irc
- fixed bug with user devoicing multiple times just toggling +v/-v.  
  Thanks naz.
- fixed a bug where refreshMenubar() wouldn't work (like anyone noticed)
- showOptionDialog("dialog name") now works properly showing the specified 
  dialog.
- added $null built in scalar to sleep has the numerical value 0 and the  
  string value "" ALWAYS!
- attempting to access an array or hash in sleep as a normal scalar will 
  result in an automatic conversion of the hash or array into a string 
  scalar.
- cleaned up AST tree generated by tree command in sleep console.
- fixed bug with using a localvariable as the temp variable for foreach 
  loops.  
- implemented a parser fix for the $+ operator.  strings like "$+ blah" 
  will no longer crash the parser...  thanks naz for finding this nasty 
  bug.   the parser just reports a syntax error.
- fixed a bug with $+; "\\ $+ $var" was not evaluating $var, now it does.  
- fixed a bug with events; event listeners from unloaded scripts didn't 
  expire even  when the script was reloaded.   Definetly a good one to have 
  fixed.
- added a little bit of parameter checking to some of the string 
  predicates.  I should do this for other stuff but to lazy.  :)
- fixed getNormal(), getOps(), getHalfOps, etc.. to return actual 
  nicknames and nothing else... thanks mexis
- fixed searchAddressList() - it was totally broken...
- stabilized data being brought into sleep a little bit...  looks to see 
  if data is null, if it is assigns it the actual null scalar rather than 
  a real null (which results in bad things)
- added more font size options to the font dialog, 13, 16, 18, and 19.  
- relocated the code for the file system bridge into the sleep code.
- send ctcp message is now echo'd to active if user requests ctcp replies
  in active as well.
- altered locations dcc echos are sent to - in general
- Auto /Window leave channel when closing windows now implies the channel 
  window should be closed on part.  Now Jono should be happy!
- bind predicate now fires a script warning if scripter tries to bind to a 
  non existent predicate environment
- added IDENT_REQUEST set to go with ident event...  altered default.irc 
  to use the set as well.
- fixed broken ident daemon...  hopefully
- enabled the SO_KEEPALIVE option for dcc sockets.  This way they'll die 
  if they are disconnected but didn't disconnect for some reason.  
  Otherwise they'll stay connected and idle for a long time :)
- altered the way notice echoes are handled, by default a notice always 
  goes to the status window on top of other relevant windows.  Now if a 
  notice goes to the active window it won't go to the status window unless 
  its supposed to.  (I know my notice echo stuff is confusing).
- spruced up /dcc output a little bit
- addItem("title", "command") can now take commands that begin with / or 
  not... doesn't matter/ser
- if a background type is selected to image but the image doesn't exist 
  then jIRC will just draw a solid colored background.
- added an INVITE set, also modified event processor to automatically fire 
  a set for an unknown event based on the event name.  So say an irc DEATH 
  event was added.  jIRC will parse this and automatically fire it as a set 
  named "DEATH" to the status window
- added built in command /clearall for Tijiez
- scripted tab nick completion - its in default.irc... 
- added -ischannel predicate to determine if the passed string is a 
  *channel*.  this does not  say is it a channel that your on or not.  It 
  just asks does the string begin with # or &. If you want to check if your 
  on a channel use if ($me ison "#whatever") { }
- added a groupNicks(@array, [n]) function that takes an array of users 
  and groups them into comma seperated groups of size n, default is 4..  
  these groups are returned as an @array
- bridged my tokenizer class (from jIRC) to sleep...  documented in the 
  jIRC scripting docs
- added getDCCAddress($dcc_conn) function for getting the address of a 
  dcc..  thanks naz for pointing this one out
- added getCurrentDirectory() to file system bridge
- renamed the client to jIRCii
- added a parseSet("SET_NAME", "target", "parms") function for firing 
  custom sets.
- added fireEvent("irc data string) and fireEvent("event", %data) for 
  firing custom events.
- made /ver and /ping into nick completing commands.
- added the ability for use of hyperlinks to outside sites inside of jIRC 
  help files...
- fixed a sleep parser bug where expressions/scalars where not being 
  allowed within "$[align]varname"
- added shift(@array) and removeAt(@array, index) to sleep...
- scripted dynamic popup that remembers the last 5 servers in the 
  Connection menu item for Tijiez


Beta (2) Release 02.07.04
====
- fixed some problems with "on event" binding
- fixed problem with isin predicate in sleep
- made client friendlier to text entered accidentally when not connected
- made socket classes a little bit more resistant to errors that bubble up 
  but in actuality have little to do with the socket itself.
- fixed bug with connect button in option window disabling keyboard shortcuts
- scripted a server_error set.
- fixed notice sets making them less ghetto.
- fixed double click event firing even when no text was double clicked on
- fixed w2k specific problem where like you couldn't select multiple
  nicknames in the listbox.  Write once, debug every where.
- tweaked icon dimensions a little bit so now the mdi window icons 
  are positioned better in Windows, they look fine in the java 
  metal look and feel, and they are somewhat better in OS X.  Its
  one big compromise as far as I'm concerned.  I'm not 100% happy with the 
  result but it will do.
- /clear|/cls by itself now clears the active window
- fixed stats bar disappearing after viewing background options
- fixed bug where dcc send start message appears twice.  
- spruced up server outputs a little adding a little color.  There are
  now 3 colors for outputs, the channel/host color, nick/address color,
  and the neutral color.  Spruced up many numeric replies including /whois.
- fixed reply 301... it will now always show up when you whois yourself
  or whois someone else.  Otherwise it will be stifled.  All of this and
  no effect on the event itself.
- numeric reply 401 is now echo'd to active window if show whois in 
  active is turned on... (401 = no such nick/channel) thanks Tijiez.
- fixed server disconnect message when /server'ing to another server.
  disconnect message now reflects the server you disconnected from.
- went to great pains to make the background images dialog a little easier 
  to use.  If an option doesn't apply to your current settings it is 
  disabled.  
- added a /ww command
- added a /help command (launches help dialog)
- implemented /run and /exec finally
- third parameter is now optional in the substr() command.
- added an option to enable/disable the statusbar in the UI Options dialog.
- added a check to jIRC for Java 1.4 or greater, if the user is not using 
  a modern vm then jIRC will exit.
- added a strip() function to strip control codes out of the parameter text.
- added a second parameter to openWindow() to make it open non-channel windows
  inactive.
- added a (%) systemProperties() function for obtaining information about the
  system...
- added an array() function for quickly initializing an array.
- removed .bmp from acceptable image type filter.  Apparently java likes 
  to freeze when loading bitmaps.  
- reworked the script loading stuff in a big way.  Most of the work 
  consisted of centralizing the script loading in the sleep API's.  I also 
  made loading a little smarter which will help just a *touch* with script 
  loading.  This was mostly for the benefit of making sleep easier to use 
  for other app developers.  I tested it but report any bugs to me please 
- fixed a bug that was really messing up the irc data structures.  The 
  mode parser did not expect -k to have a parameter associated with it.  
  As such the targets got messed up for subsequent modes in the same mode 
  string.  This could really desynch the client.  Should be okay now.  
- Changed configuration defaults... jIRC will now use a single document 
  interface by default on every platform except Windows (were it defaults 
  to MDI).  You can switch between SDI and MDI in the Options -> UI 
  Options dialog.
- Adjusted some of the blank space in the dialogs.  Dropped forced white 
  space from 10 pixels to 5 pixels.  To help accomodate for look and feels 
  that love to suck up screen space.  Writing good looking dialogs for a 
  'skinnable' app is a pain in the ass... trust me.
- fixed a bug with the colormap (it only allowed colors 0-98), try ^k99 
  in the old beta... it will completely jack the display..
- reset the colormap...  all slots have an entry and 1-16 are properly 
  coordinated with the defacto mIRC standard.
- added a baseDirectory() function which returns the directory where the 
  jirc files are located at.
- added an interpretation for Undernet reply 330 (User is logged in as)
- added a key binding to the menus.irc: Escape - minimizes active window
- /dcc accept now takes another optional parameter allowing you to 
  specify a new location for the file to be dumped to... if your 
  accepting a receive.
- added closeDCC($dcc_conn) method to close an active dcc... since my 
  /dcc close is kind of inadequate... :)
- expanded /dcc close a little to take: /dcc close [send|chat|receive] <nick>
- redid the dcc error messages a little so they keep the exception type 
  out of it.
- readded the /wall and /wallex commands, along with sets SEND_WALL and 
  SEND_WALLEX
- added a bunch of functions for manipulating the multiserver aspect of 
  the client... kinda kewl..  now you can code scripts to make the tabs 
  flash and stuph.

Initial Beta (1) 01.31.04
=====
This thing has been in development since 99, I've had other strains of
betas going up to beta 12.  So don't think this is anything new...
