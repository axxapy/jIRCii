This code was hacked together, my C is admitably a little rusty and I've never done
*gack* Win32 development before.

I used the free lcc C development environment for Windows to compile this code

http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/

I decided to be nice and hack the makefile so once lcc was properly installed you can
cd to the directory where this code is and simply type 'make'.

The makefile comments have more details...

Good luck!
