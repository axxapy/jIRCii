The documents in this directory are just a loose snapshot of some of the project related stuff.
Buried within the source code for jIRCii are various text files spilling out design decisions
and ideas.

If you want to mess around with the source code do a find for all of the text files first.  

They'll help offer some hints as to what was going on.
