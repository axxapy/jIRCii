For text area pre render a glyph vector and draw that.

Theres a new way to get the bounds of a string within a font render 
context

find out how to get font render context.

consider possibly using suns classes for wordwrapping.  May have to 
resort to my own classes as they carry over text attributes.  But if 
suns classes can handle text attributes then why not.

java.awt.font is your friend

my own code can be trusted over suns architecture still.

have a safe bounds optimization i.e. no wordwrapping needed as length
 of this string is x pixels.

use chapter 14 of Java2D book to test FPS of component.  Keep testing
until I end up with something I like.
