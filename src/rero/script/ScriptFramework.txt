Scripting Framework - this is the *core* of the scripting stuff
------------------
The purpose of the scripting framework is to provide a simple interface
to the sleep scripting stuff.  

Exported Capabilities
--------------------
- Call a function
- load a script
- unload a script

Exported Events
---------------
none so far.

Exported Data Structures
---------------
loaded scripts
variables

Anything and everything should be imported eventually.  This file here is the simplest abstraction
of the sleep stuff (to it).

Notes of Import
---------------
The ScriptCore utilizes a client state variable "loaded.scripts".  This is used to signal a change
to components that a script has been loaded or unloaded in the "internal" sense.  The value loaded.scripts
does not actually contain anything it is just used for global signalling purposes.  

The script files that we have loaded are contained in a variable called script.files and that variable
is dealt with and managed by rero.client.script.ScriptManager.   Fun fun fun.
