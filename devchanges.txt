- Fixed issue with DGroup() instances where it was not drawing a border window. I neglected to insert a default value for the new property useBorder (boolean), so it was always false. Doh.
- Added Package.Apple.sh for packaging only Apple Mac OS X jerk.dmg file
- Added dialog box for Attention / Notifications in Interface Options -> Notifications for setting on what conditions the OS X dock icon should bounce to let the user know a message, notice, channel chat, etc. is waiting, and whether or not the bouncing should repeat until answered ("critical" boolean flag to requestUserAttention() method on OS X Java class)

Upcoming 0.9.1 Development Notes (Differs from 0.9.0):
===
- StringInput now has an initializer that accepts font size, along with appropriate overloaded addStringInput() method (TODO: make it accept a Font)
- theApplication is now set at declaration with getApplication() per Apple's specs.
- Removed Help items that got over-written by subsequent items
- Changed static path of SetFile to dynamic `which SetFile` in Package.sh
- findScripts() replaced with single findScript(). Script management code cleaned up greatly, things handled more consistently internally, and as a - Values in the Server class are trimmed prior to being assigned to help avoid sloppy argument parsing issues.
- Scripts now all referenced by their absolute path to avoid the same script being loaded twice or more.
- Support for high-resolution "Retina" display added via key in Info.plist in Apple package.
- connectToServer() code, Server dialog, and Server class modified to fix a intermittent issue with /server and stored servers, extra spaces in the /server line, etc.
- Reflection used to trigger Apple specific requestUserAttention(), bouncing the dock icon up and down; won't cause an error on non-Apple systems. Plan on implementing for Windows and Linux as well.
- toArrayList() method added to TokenizedString class; converts tokenized string to an ArrayList.
- parmsToArrayList() method added in BuiltInCommands, to convert parameters to an ArrayList. Accepts a parameter to signify that blank parameters should be nuked.
- createHomogenousChannelModesList() added; returns MODE line acting on all targets specified, to the maximum number of modes per line specified by IRC server. This provides fix for /op, /deop, etc.
- Now identifying NETWORK, MAXMODES, CHANTYPES from the IRC server and using them in the code.
- Fixed util/debugjirc.sh
