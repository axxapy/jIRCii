jIRCii - Java IRC Client
=================
*This is fork of https://code.google.com/p/jircii*

jIRCii is an internet relay chat client for MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. Pretend ircii and mIRC had a baby. Now pretend that BitchX was the real father. That's jIRCii.

jIRCii is keeping the IRC culture of the nineties alive. jIRCii displays terminal-style graphics in most fonts. It's highly scriptable with several themes to choose from. You get to choose how much GUI you want. IRC out of one window or make jIRCii look like mIRC with a new window for each channel.

No matter how IRC evolves, rest assured this is one client that will not look like an instant messenger.
